This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you use the state variable within a component's render method before the component has fully mounted and the state has been set.

```javascript
//Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text> {/* Potential error here */} 
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

The `count` variable might be `undefined` initially leading to unexpected behavior or a runtime error if you directly use it without a check for `undefined` or `null`.
